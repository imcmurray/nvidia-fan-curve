# Nvidia Fan Curve

Keep those Nvidia GPU's cool and efficient by setting a desired temperature and have fan-control.pl automatically adjust each GPU's fan speed to maintain your temperature.

## Use

Simply download this respository, or just the fan-control.pl file to your miner, make it executable (chmod +x fan-control.pl), then simply execute it (./fan-control.pl).

I also assume that you have already already installed the Nvidia drivers and have set them up accordingly. If you're simply ramping up your fans to 100% then this could save you a few watts of power buy adjusting and maintaining a desired temperature. Lower wattage means more profit.

Your feedback is greatly appreciate.
